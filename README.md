Ember Blog
====

Ember front end and rails backend. This will eventually replace my wordpress blog I have.


### Website todos
- [ ] root route = posts
- [ ] hitting the create page = login page if not logged in.
- [ ] be able to save drafts
- [ ] publish and in publish posts
- [ ] delete posts
- [ ] SEO fields on the post like the wordpress SEO. (I think taking the excerpt and title would be enough)

### Nice haves:
- [ ] dashboard showing all posts (published, draft, unpublished).
- [ ] dashboard pulling in google analytics API with d3 graphs
